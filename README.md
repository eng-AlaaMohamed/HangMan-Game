# HangMan-Game
It is a game based on the principle of guessing by choosing a
classification in a random way, then a place is shown to enter a
group of letters into it, and this place is restricted to a number
of boxes. If the letter choice is correct, you continue, and if it is
wrong, the game draws part of the gallows.
